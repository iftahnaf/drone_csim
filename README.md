# About Vector Guidance

Guidance laws that were originally developed for missile guidance, but fit very well for guiding drones
that can implement acceleration in all spatial directions. The laws also take into account aircraft
limitations, such as velocity or acceleration saturation. The implementation of the laws is simple,
efficient and doesn’t require high processing power, as most of the solutions are analytical and don’t
require complicated numerical solvers. The laws were developed by prof. Shaul Gutman.
